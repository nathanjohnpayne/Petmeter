 * (black, white, a two-pixel band, black): sixteen rows cannot pay for that
 * twice and still hold two lines. And it is lit-on-dark, not black-on-white.
 * A 72x16 white slab is the brightest thing this device can show, in the
 * state that mostly means the Mac is asleep; and a one-pixel dark stroke
 * inside lit LEDs blooms shut, so the body would not read. The matrix
 * decides the tonality; the structure is what reads as a Mac dialog.
 *
 * The icon is the System 7 caution icon redrawn at 13x12 from the 32x32
 * original -- sides stepping one column every two rows, a solid tip, the dot
 * a row clear of the base -- a rendering at a size Apple never shipped, not a
 * copy of their bitmap. The original's stem is two pixels wide on an
 * even-width triangle; at this size two lit columns read as "!!", so the stem
 * and dot are one column, and the width is odd so that column sits on the
 * triangle's axis.
 *
 * The box is solid black on purpose. An image tombstone does not destroy the
 * element -- the previous card's mascot survives it -- so the dialog covers
 * the mascot's slot with an opaque fill rather than trusting it to leave. And
 * the icon takes the mascot's id: `pet` is the app's one image, so the icon

 * answering yet the alert holds off for FAILS_BEFORE_ALERT failures and their
 * backoff -- several seconds of nothing, on a device whose job is to be
 * glanceable. The gap gets the caption row: "Connecting" in the label's
 * place, dim, with an ellipsis that cycles. That is what the moment is, a
 * card whose number has not arrived; when it does, the label lands on the
 * same row in the draw that tombstones the word, and the handover is the
 * card appearing above it. No new id, no frame, no mascot: the mascot means
 * "host present", which is exactly what is not known yet.
 *
 * Every tick is a POST to the device, and on the device's own loopback a
 * one-element draw takes 0.5-0.7s to come back (the sub-100ms figure in the
 * README is measured from the Mac). So the in-flight guard sets the pace, not
 * the interval: about a frame every 0.7s, and never a queue. It is short-lived
 * by construction: the clock is cleared -- and the tick in flight waited out
 * -- before any real frame is sent, so a tick cannot land on top of a card.
 *
 * What it cannot cover, measured off the device log: the runtime takes ~4.6s
 * from "Running script" to the first line of this file. Then module init is
 * ~0.5s, the clear ~0.4s and the first POST ~0.7s, so the caption is up about
 * 1.7s after the app's first line runs -- and the first real frame follows
 * the data by ~3s, of which ~2s is JerryScript building an 18-element frame
 * and ~1.2s the device taking it.
 *
 * It does not return on a reconnect. After the first frame the last good card
 * stands until the alert takes over (see FAILS_BEFORE_ALERT): a single missed
 * poll flicking the screen to "Connecting" is the class of flicker that made
 * pause break the display, and a card a few seconds stale is a truer reading
 * than a blank one. The alert is a real frame as well, so from alert back to
