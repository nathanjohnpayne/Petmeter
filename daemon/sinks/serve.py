"""Serve the latest payload so a device-side app can pull it.

The BUSY Bar sink pushes; this lets the bar's own app pull. The difference
matters at the moment you *look* at the device: a push shows whatever the
daemon last sent, a pull shows what is true now, which is what you want from
something you selected out of a menu.

Deliberately not a web server. It answers exactly one path, holds one value in
memory, writes no files and takes no input beyond the request line. A daemon
that reads your OAuth tokens has no business growing a framework.

BINDING. Over USB the bar is 10.0.4.20 and the host is 10.0.4.21, both fixed,
so the default binds to that interface alone -- not 0.0.0.0. The payload is
your usage, which is nobody else's business on a coffee-shop network, and
binding narrow is cheaper than explaining to a firewall later. Override with
`busybar_serve` in the config if the bar talks over Wi-Fi instead.

# concluded the host was gone and drew "no host". Pausing was therefore a
# button that broke the screen, and unpausing was the only cure, which is a
# miserable thing to discover with no host in sight.
#
# The cap lives on THIS side on purpose. The app sends its own `wait`, and an
# app is already installed on a device out there asking for 8000; capping
