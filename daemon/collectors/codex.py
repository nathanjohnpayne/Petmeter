"""Codex usage collector.

Two sources, in preference order:

1. `GET https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` with the OAuth token the
   Codex CLI stores in ~/.codex/auth.json. Live, one request, and explicit
   about which limit it is reporting. This is what the Codex CLI and CodexBar
   use. It is UNDOCUMENTED and can change without notice, hence (2).

2. The `rate_limits` object the CLI records into its session rollout JSONL
   under ~/.codex/sessions. No network, but only as fresh as your last Codex
   session -- reported honestly via UsageSnapshot.stale_seconds.

ACCOUNT LIMIT vs PER-MODEL LIMITS -- the trap in this data. Two different
things are reported side by side:

  * the plan limit           (top-level `rate_limit`, log `limit_id` "codex")
  * per-model buckets, e.g.  GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark / metered_feature
                             "codex_bengalfox"

They are unrelated numbers. Taking the newest rollout record blindly read 0%
off a per-model bucket while the account was at 78%. Both readers below select
the account limit explicitly; per-model buckets are exposed separately by the
probe script but never merged into the snapshot.

Per the free-ride rule in this package's docstring, a 401 here means "no data",
never a token refresh -- the Codex CLI owns that token.
